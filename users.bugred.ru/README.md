Users (http://users.bugred.ru) - Free Test Project with Bugs and SOAP/REST Methods.

In this project, I created new users, companies, created new tasks for users, linked users to companies, searched for users, added avatars to them and deleted users from system using Postman and SoapUI. All necessary documentation was in Counfluence. 

doRegister - method for registering a new user.
"Postman - doRegister" tab - created positive and negative test cases for new user registration using REST requests in Postman.
"SoapUI - doRegister" tab - created positive and negative test cases with execution for new user registration using SOAP requests in SoapUI.
